# Melanoma Detection Assignment
> Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.


The data set contains the following nine diseases:

- Actinic keratosis
- Basal cell carcinoma
- Dermatofibroma
- Melanoma
- Nevus
- Pigmented benign keratosis
- Seborrheic keratosis
- Squamous cell carcinoma
- Vascular lesion


## General Information
- We aim to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based model with the capability to accurately identify cases of melanoma. Melanoma, a form of skin cancer, can pose a severe threat if not detected at an early stage, constituting a significant portion of skin cancer-related fatalities (about 75%). The implementation of a solution capable of analyzing images and promptly notifying dermatologists about the presence of melanoma holds the potential to mitigate substantial manual effort currently involved in the diagnostic process.
- Our project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically a CNN architecture, to address the critical problem of melanoma detection. The background of our endeavor is rooted in the urgency to enhance early diagnosis capabilities, thereby potentially saving lives and improving patient outcomes. By building an efficient model, we intend to streamline the diagnostic workflow for dermatologists and facilitate quicker interventions.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture consists of multiple convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. The architecture was designed to learn relevant features from the images for accurate classification.
